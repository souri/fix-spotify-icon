> Shell script to fix the Spotify icon in Ubuntu 14.04.

Since Ubuntu 14.04, Spotify uses a low resolution icon in the system tray. You can [replace the icon manually](http://askubuntu.com/questions/449392/how-to-fix-fuzzy-spotify-icon-in-the-icon-tray). But the icon is overwritten whenever Spotify updates. In other words, you have to fix the icon every time Spotify is updated. This script minimizes the pain with a simple one-line command.


Usage:

Clone the repository and run 

./fix-spotify-icon.sh (if you want the dark icon)

OR

./fix-spotify-icon-gray.sh (for the gray ambience icon)
